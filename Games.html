		<h3>Fabricators</h3>
		<p>Fabricators is a text based adventure game I designed myself, where you play as the main character Sam or as he is better known, Special Agent 16, Fabricator. The game starts the protagonist waking up from hyper sleep in a space ship headed to a planet he will be teraforming in a way. Sam is a fabricator which is a secret agent cultivated by the furistic United Nations to collapse the goverment of other words. He achieves such a feat by becoming one of the dominant spiceis' diplomats and inspiring political discourse. The objective of the United Nations is to cause the demise of the planets main species so that humans can inhabit the planet with out having bad press from the media acusing the U.N. of being inhumane. Throughout the game Sam has limited interaction with anyone other than his intelligence relay Gene, who he has never met in person. She advises him and collects his mission reports. Sam's objective is to complete his mission as quickly as possible. Under a lot of pressure already, he works for the U.N. because they promise the safty of his younger brother, the one thing our protagonist truely cares about. Embark on an epic journey of deciding between the mission and your moral standing.</p>
